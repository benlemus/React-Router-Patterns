### `Dog Directory`

This is a directy to show dogs. Each dog card displays a photo, name, age and some facts about that dog. Each name is clickable that links to their individual page.

### `Color Factory`

This is a page that saves colors in the localStorage and has seperate pages using that color for all colors. You can add a color by naming it anything and picking the color via the color pick input.
